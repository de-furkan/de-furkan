`Where my energy is now :)`
- 🎉 I’m currently expanding my object-oriented programming skills through active learning and side projects.
- 🔭 And this is my most recent project (still working on it) 👉🏻 You can stay updated here once the project is released.
- 🚀 I'm also on a mission to take my Selenium, TestNG, API, database testing, and Cucumber skills up a notch.
