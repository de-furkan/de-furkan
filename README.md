  Hey thereüëãüèª, I'm Furkan! I'm a Software QA Engineer Student living in the UK.
</h1>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  With a solid foundation in both manual and automated testing, I bring to the table a good understanding of programming languages, particularly Java and SQL. Although I am still expanding my knowledge of Java, I am committed to continuous learning and development.

At present, my focus is on deepening my understanding of Java and enhancing my skills in QA Testing. I am actively exploring tech stacks such as Cucumber, Selenium, TestNG, Appium, Cypress, and RestAssured. My journey in the realm of programming and testing is always evolving, and I am excited about the learning opportunities ahead.

<h2>Featured Projects</h2>
<p>
  I am excited to share with you some of my favourite projects that I've worked on. These projects reflect my learning journey and showcase my skills in various programming languages and tools. Each project has been a unique experience, pushing me to explore new concepts and challenges.

<h3>ATM Project</h3>

<p>
  One of my most challenging projects to date was the construction of a virtual ATM that operates entirely through the console. This project presented numerous challenges, including:

- Integrating various components together.
- Applying object-oriented programming principles.
- Establishing and synchronising the connection between the user interface and the database.
- Conducting manual and automated testing of different components, including unit testing.

This project pushed me to expand my skills and understanding in these areas, making it a valuable learning experience.
